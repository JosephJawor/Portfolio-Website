Iâ€™m excited to share my portfolio website, this is a space where I can showcase my journey as a Frontend Developer. The design is responsive, ensuring that it looks great on any device, whether you're on your phone or at a computer screen. The fixed header makes navigation easy, allowing visitors to explore different sections seamlessly.

In the About section, I introduce myself with a professional headshot and a brief overview of my background. I also provide links for downloading my CV and contacting me directly via email and/or LinkedIn, making it easy for anyone interested in connecting.

The Experience section highlights my skills and the work I've done specifically pertaining to the creative/design and tech sectors, detailing my journey in Frontend Development and Videography & Photography. I believe sharing my experiences helps others understand my growth and the diverse skill set I've developed over the years that would allow for a more diverse point of view.

In the Projects section, I showcase some of my recent work, like a Calendar web application and a Calculator tool. Each project comes with a description, links to live demos, and access to their GitHub repositories, allowing visitors to see my coding capabilities firsthand.
This portfolio is ultimately a reflection of my professional journey I'm on as a developer and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
